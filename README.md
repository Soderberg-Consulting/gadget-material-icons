# gadget-material-icons - UNDER DEVELOPMENT [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jessgusclark/gadget-material-icons.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jessgusclark/gadget-material-icons)

A OUCampus gadget and xsl transformation that allows users to insert Google's Material icons.

This repository contains three sections:

- **CSS** is code that needs to be added to the University's master CSS file or linked to.
- **XSL** is a XSL transformation snippet that needs to be added to the snippets file and handles converting the table into the icon code.
- **gadget** is the gadget that the end users will use to insert [Google's Material Icons](https://design.google.com/icons/) into their sites.
